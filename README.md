advent of code 2016

aoc2016.k - k versions

aoc2016.q - q translations

Tried to credit people where possible, let me know if I've missed anything

Only had a finite amount of energy for tidying things up and/or trying to optimize, so I'm sure many of these are neither the best way, nor the tersest way

Note, some of the problems run much faster when running with multiple cores (as they use peach), particularly 5, 11, 14 and 24
