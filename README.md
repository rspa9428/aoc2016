advent of code 2016

aoc2016.k - k versions

aoc2016.q - q translations

Tried to credit people where possible, let me know if I've missed anything

Only had a finite amount of energy for tidying things up and/or trying to optimize, so I'm sure many of these are neither the fastest, nor the tersest way

Note, some of the problems run much faster when running with multiple cores (as they use peach), particularly 5, 11, 14 and 24

# assembunny (problems 12, 23 and 25)
For the assembunny problems, I opted for some manual alterations (as opposed to coding up the corresponding alterations to unravel loops) to the input p files (p12, 23, 25). Think there are plenty of discussions on why/how to do the alterations floating around on www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode for anyone that's interested. Without doing these alterations, the code will likely run forever on those problems
